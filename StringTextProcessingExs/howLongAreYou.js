//get unique words
//I am assuming that upper or lowercase does not matter

//first: all lowercase
//second: split to get list of workds
//use a dictionary to hold all the words and word length
  //we will keep reassigning when a word is repeated but that is fine
//convert dictionary to [[]. [], ...]

//LS solutoin is even easier where the solution assumes that duplicate word
//don't exist.
