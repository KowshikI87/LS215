/*

A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number
that is a multiple of 7, with all of its digits occurring exactly once each.

For example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd),
97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not
(the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the
next featured number greater than the integer.
Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.

NOTE: The largest possible featured number is 9876543201.
