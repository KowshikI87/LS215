Problem
- input: text
  - given: two array of words; one for positive words and one for negative
- output:
  - how many positive words; what these words are
  - how many negative words; what these words are
  - sentimnet of text (positive / negative / neutral)
    - positive: number of positive word count > number of negative word count
    - negative, neutral: see defn. of positive to interpolate

- other requirements:
  - have to count the exact word. for example: count dream but not "dreams"

- assumption
  - words are seperated by a single space. even if they are seperted
    - by multiple space then it is fine because those spaces won't get
      - counted anyways
  - sdfd

Example/Test Cases
- given

Data Structure
- array

Algorithm
- positiveWords = [...], negativeWords = [...]
- curntTextPosWords = [], curntTextNegWords = []
- numPosWords = 0; numNegativeWords = 0
- split on " " to get list of words
  - for positive words
    - if the word is in positiveWords then numPosWords += 1
    - if the word is not curntTextPosWords then curntTextPosWords.push(word)
  - for negative words
    - similar logic as above
  - final output is easy to give


Code


Correction from LS solution
- [OKAY] we can include duplicate words multiple times in positiveWord or
  - negativeWord
- [OKAY]I did not know that using "match" method would give a list of words
- [KINDA OKAY] another thing I missed is converting text to lowercase first
  - I would have caught this later on
- [KINDA OKAY] another correction is that the words in the text
  - could have apostrophe. that's why they are using the regex pattern they are
  - but it does not matter as my list of positive and negative words don't have
    - apostrophe in it
